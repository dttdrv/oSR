### Phase 0 Bootstrap

- Initialized the repository for the first oSR prototype scaffold.
- Decision: v0 targets FSR3.1 / FidelityFX API style DX12 input first.
- Decision: OptiScaler and similar GPL projects are research/reference only; no GPL implementation code is copied into oSR.
- Decision: SDK/sample apps come before real games.
- Decision: v0 is super resolution only. Frame generation, anti-cheat games, DLSS/NVNGX spoofing, XeSS runtime replacement, Vulkan, DX11, and older static FSR2 pattern scanning are out of scope.
- Created modular CMake targets: `osr_core`, `osr_dx12`, `osr_fsr_bridge`, `osr_reconstruction`, `osr_vendor_stubs`, `osr_profiles`, and `osr_debug`.
- Implemented the initial API-neutral `FrameContext`, validation report, structured logger, config loader, resource registry, FFX-style bridge skeleton, DX12 debug upscale metadata path, reconstruction placeholders, profile loader, debug metadata writer, and a frame-context validation test.
- Verification: `cmake --preset ninja-debug` completed successfully with GNU 15.2.0 on Windows.
- Verification: `cmake --build --preset ninja-debug` completed successfully.
- Verification: `ctest --preset ninja-debug` passed `1/1` tests.
- Not run: AMD FidelityFX SDK / FSR3 sample proof-of-life, because the SDK sample is not present in this repository yet.
